* How to use spoon

To execute the program you do:

#+begin_src shell
nix-shell
rebar3 shell
#+end_src

Next, you need a Silverware file (*.sw*) with code that you want to evaluate. You can have Emacs support evaluating the file *editor/silverware-mode.el*
There are some samples in the *examples* folder.
In the shell, proceed with:

#+begin_src shell
spoon:main(<PATH_TO_SAMPLE_FILE>).
#+end_src

Here it is an example of output:

#+begin_src shell
  Erlang/OTP 24 [erts-12.2] [source] [64-bit] [smp:16:16] [ds:16:16:10] [async-threads:1] [jit]

  Eshell V12.2  (abort with ^G)
  1> spoon:main("examples/advanced.sw")
  SPOON| {literal, {integer, 60}}
  ok
#+end_src
